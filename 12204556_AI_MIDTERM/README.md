               Assignment Overview: Conveyor Belt Maintenance with Machine Learning

                                 Overview

In this assignment, we address the challenge of predicting conveyor belt failures in industrial settings. We employ a machine learning approach, specifically using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model, to detect failures and alert maintenance teams in real-time. The assignment is divided into several tasks, each building upon the previous one:
   
                                Model Architecture

- An LSTM layer with 64 units to capture sequential patterns.
- A Dense layer with a sigmoid activation function for binary classification.

The model is compiled using binary cross-entropy loss and the Adam optimizer, which are suitable for binary classification tasks.
                          
                                DATA GENERATION 
                                
                  Task 1: Generating Sequential Data
In the first task, we create a function to generate sequential data that simulates sensor readings from conveyor belts. This data includes temperature, vibration, and belt speed, and we can introduce failures at specific probabilities. We demonstrate generating sequences with both low and high failure probabilities.

             Task 2: Data Preprocessing
The second task involves data preprocessing. We create a function to preprocess the generated sequential data. This function extracts numerical features from the data, scales the data using the StandardScaler, and splits it into training and testing sets. The result is ready for training a machine learning model.

                Task 3: LSTM Model Implementation
The third task focuses on building an LSTM model using TensorFlow and Keras. The model architecture is designed with suitable layers, including an LSTM layer and a Dense layer with a sigmoid activation function. The model is then compiled with appropriate loss and optimization functions.

                     Task 4: Model Training
Task 4 involves training the LSTM model using the prepared training data. We specify the number of training epochs and batch size. We monitor the training process and evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy. This step is crucial for ensuring the model's ability to detect failures effectively.

                  Task 5: Real-Time Simulation
The final task aims to simulate real-time data for conveyor belts, make predictions using the trained LSTM model, and implement alerting logic for maintenance teams. To achieve this, we generate real-time sensor data, scale and reshape it, predict failure probabilities, and alert the maintenance team when a failure is detected. The process is simulated for a specified number of iterations with a time interval between data points.
                
                  Task 6:Complete the Assignment

After finishing all the tasks, task 6 has been finished successfully.                  

                         Code Integration:

In the final code integration, we bring together the components developed in previous tasks. This includes loading the scaler trained in Task 2, implementing a function to generate real-time data, and incorporating the LSTM model for predictions. The code simulates the real-time environment, making predictions based on generated data and alerting maintenance teams when necessary.

This assignment demonstrates a holistic approach to conveyor belt maintenance using machine learning. It covers data generation, preprocessing, model development, training, and real-time monitoring for proactive maintenance. The ability to predict failures in advance can significantly reduce downtime and maintenance costs in industrial settings.

                              Summary
                              
The final code combines all these components to perform real-time predictions and alerts, mimicking the environment where the model would be deployed for practical maintenance tasks. The model leverages historical data and is fine-tuned to make accurate predictions in real-time.
